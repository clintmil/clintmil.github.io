#### Available Positions

**Postdoctoral Fellow – Functional Genomics** 

We are seeking a highly motivated and energetic postdoctoral fellow with a background in genetics, molecular biology or similar field to investigate the genetic basis of coronary artery disease. This project will focus on investigating the causal mechanisms of novel loci associated with CAD and will involve the generation of genomic datasets in normal and diseased environments. The primary goals of this project are: 1) to elucidate the role of genetic variation on transcription, TF occupancy and chromatin structure, 2) to perform targeted and multiplexed perturbation assays in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9 at candidate loci, 3) to validate candidate drugs or biomarkers in phenotypic screens for cardiovascular diseases. 

The candidate will have access to state-of-the art facilities and will be exposed to a stimulating and multi-disciplinary environment in the Center for Public Health Genomics, led by Drs. Stephen Rich and Charles Farber. This work will involve close collaborations with Drs. Mete Civelek, Chongzhi Zang and others. The candidate will also benefit from strong collaborations with Dr. Gary Owens and other members of the Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center.

__Qualifications:__
* PhD or MD/PhD in quantitative life sciences
*	Deep knowledge in human genetics, molecular biology, or similar field
*	Excellent written and oral communication skills
*	Self-starter, independent, and organized

__Additional qualifications (not required):__
*	Knowledge in bioinformatics, genomics, and statistics
*	Knowledge of genome editing and high-throughput screens

**About Us:**

The Miller Lab of Cardiovascular Functional Genomics is located in the Center for Public Health Genomics (CPHG) at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. The CPHG was established in 2007 and focuses on translational and personalized medicine by moving gene discovery (and the manner in which genes interact with environment) into the delivery of health care and of disease prevention both in clinical settings as well as in the community. The University of Virginia is an equal opportunity employer and minority applicants are encouraged to apply. 

**How to apply:**

**Postdoctoral Fellow – Computational Genomics**

We are seeking a highly motivated and talented postdoctoral fellow with a background in bioinformatics or computer science to investigate the genetic basis of coronary artery disease (and other related diseases). This project will focus on the integration of large-scale human genetic and multi-omic datasets (e.g. bulk and single-cell RNA-seq, ATAC-seq) from normal and diseased environments. Ultimately the goals of this work are: 1) to elucidate novel disease associated loci and regulatory profiles, 2) to map context-specific gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, 3) to construct and test causal regulatory networks. The candidate will also be expected to work with collaborators to assist in building bioinformatics software and infrastructure around these genomic datasets.

The candidate will have access to a broad range of large-scale genetic and genomic datasets and will be exposed to a stimulating and multi-disciplinary environment in the Center for Public Health Genomics, led by Drs. Stephen Rich and Charles Farber. This work will involve close collaborations with Drs. Mete Civelek, Chongzhi Zang and others. The candidate will also benefit from strong collaborations with Dr. Gary Owens and other members of the Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center. 

__Qualifications:__
* PhD in bioinformatics, computer science, genetics or related field
*	Deep knowledge in a quantitative field involving computational analysis 
*	Knowledge of human genetics, statistical genetics and molecular biology
*	Proficiency in scripting (e.g. python, perl, bash) and statistical analysis (e.g. R)
*	Excellent written and verbal communication skills 

__Additional qualifications (not required):__
*	Proficiency in database language (e.g. SQL, Reddis, Mongo)
*	Proficiency in machine learning, deep learning or artificial intelligence

**Staff Scientist or Research Associate in Cardiovascular Functional Genomics**  

We are seeking a highly motivated staff scientist or research associate with a strong background in genetics, molecular biology, cell biology, developmental biology, engineering or similar fields to investigate the genetic basis of coronary artery disease. Our group investigates the causal mechanisms of loci associated with CAD and related cardiovascular diseases, with a focus on understanding the regulation and targeting of mural cell signaling pathways. These efforts are expected to reveal the ‘hidden risk’ for complex diseases for more precise prediction and early stage prevention. 

The candidate will be involved in generating various bulk and single-cell genomic datasets (e.g. RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq) from both normal and diseased environments, in order to study mural cell regulation and disease mechanisms. In addition the candidate will serve as a laboratory manager and will thus be responsible for ordering, maintaining laboratory safety, IRB and animal protocols, as well as perform histology, immunohistochemistry, tissue dissection, and cell culture. The candidate will work closely with other lab members and will be expected to assist in training as needed. The candidate will benefit from a highly interactive and stimulating environment in the Center for Public Health Genomics, with strong collaborations with nearby labs and members of the Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center.

__Qualifications:__
*	PhD or MD in life sciences or medical field
*	Knowledge in human genetics, molecular biology, or similar field
*	Excellent written and oral communication skills
*	Excellent organization and management skills
*	Ability to work independently and as team member

__Additional qualifications (not required):__
* Knowledge in one or more fields: bioinformatics, genomics, and statistics
*	Knowledge of genome editing or high-throughput screens
