####Available Positions

**Postdoctoral Fellow â€“ Functional Genomics** 

We are seeking a highly motivated and energetic postdoctoral fellow with a background in genetics, molecular biology or similar field to investigate the genetic basis of coronary artery disease. This project will focus on investigating the causal mechanisms of novel loci associated with CAD and will involve the generation of genomic datasets in normal and diseased environments. The primary goals of this project are: 1) to elucidate the role of genetic variation on transcription, TF occupancy and chromatin structure, 2) to perform targeted and multiplexed perturbation assays in vitro using CRISPR/Cas9 at candidate loci, 3) to validate candidate drugs or biomarkers in phenotypic screens for cardiovascular diseases. 

The candidate will have access to state-of-the art facilities and will be exposed to a stimulating and multi-disciplinary environment in the Center for Public Health Genomics, led by Drs. Stephen Rich and Charles Farber. This work will involve close collaborations with Drs. Mete Civelek, Chongzhi Zang and others. The candidate will also benefit from strong collaborations with Dr. Gary Owens and other members of the Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center.

__Qualifications:__
* PhD or MD/PhD in quantitative life sciences
*	Deep knowledge in human genetics, molecular biology, or similar field
*	Excellent written and oral communication skills
*	Self-starter, independent, and organized

__Additional qualifications (not required):__
*	Knowledge in bioinformatics, genomics, and statistics
*	Knowledge of genome editing and high-throughput screens

**About Us:**

The Miller Lab of Cardiovascular Functional Genomics is located in the Center for Public Health Genomics (CPHG) at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. The CPHG was established in 2007 and focuses on translational and personalized medicine by moving gene discovery (and the manner in which genes interact with environment) into the delivery of health care and of disease prevention both in clinical settings as well as in the community. The University of Virginia is an equal opportunity employer and minority applicants are encouraged to apply. 

**How to apply:**
