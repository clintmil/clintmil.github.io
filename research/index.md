 <span style="color:#B8860B"> **1. Map genetic variation and mechanisms associated with coronary artery disease (CAD).** </span>

One of the major challenges in the post-GWAS field is interpreting the function of non-coding variation, which often requires understanding of how these variants alter gene expression at the cellular and molecular levels. To address the function of vascular wall CAD loci, we recently established bulk ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq datasets in both naïve and stimulated primary coronary artery smooth muscle cells and tissues. Our goal is to employ these multi-omic profiles across multiple tissues and disease states for multiple individuals in order to capture the function and directionality of these genetic variants in specific environments. These molecular profiles have already enabled identification of candidate CAD loci regulating diverse vessel wall processes. By integrating expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), allele-specific expression (ASE), and chromatin accessibility mapping with specific perturbation and functional assays we will focus on dissecting causal regulatory variants and mechanisms at other cardiovascular disease (CVD) loci. 

<span style="color:#B8860B"> **2. Investigate role of genetic and environmental interactions in CAD.** </span>

Another poorly addressed issue in the field is the role of gene-gene (GxG) interactions (e.g. epistasis) and gene-environment (GxE) interactions in driving heritable risk for complex diseases. Our previous work at the TCF21 locus identified multiple interactions with other CAD loci (e.g. 9p21 and PDGFD). To better address biological epistasis in CAD, we are employing genome-wide interaction screens for other disease-associated “master regulator” transcription factors in both normal and diseased tissues. These approaches will reveal insights into the combinatorial effects of genetic variation on the vascular wall interactome. We have also recently identified specific environmental factors interacting with smooth muscle CAD genes (e.g. TCF21) related to pro-inflammatory signaling. Both experimental and computational approaches will be employed to further explore these potential interactions across different individuals and disease states.
 
<span style="color:#B8860B"> **3. Investigate mural cell function and drug repositioning strategies for CVD.** </span>

One of the distinguishing features of mural cells (smooth muscle cells and pericytes) is their ability to contract to regulate blood pressure and vascular tone. Aberrant contractile gene expression may lead to vascular dysfunction and hypertension, which is the leading heritable risk factor for CVD. We have identified a number of contractile genes, which are downregulated with atherosclerosis progression and have been associated with CVD in human populations. We will investigate the impact of both non-coding and coding variation on SMC and pericyte contractile function using high-throughput screening in human vascular tissue models under naïve and perturbed conditions. We will also employ a number of bioinformatics approaches to construct unbiased gene-target networks and explore repositioning opportunities as an individualized therapeutic approach.
