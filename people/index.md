Clint L. Miller - Principal Investigator

- Postdoc, Human Genetics, Stanford University 
- PhD, Pharmacology, University of Rochester
- MS, Pharmacology, University of Rochester
- BS, Neuroscience, University of Maryland, Baltimore County 

Clint started his lab at the University of Virginia after serving on the faculty and completing postdoctoral training in human genetics (Quertermous lab) at Stanford University. There he investigated the causal genetic mechanisms of coronary artery disease loci identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies. He identified mechanisms for multiple genes mediating vessel wall injury responses in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells and mouse models. He is currently an Assistant Professor of Public Health Sciences and a resident member of the Center for Public Health Genomics. He is also a member of the Data Science Institute and the Robert M. Berne Cardiovascular Research Center and has secondary faculty appointments in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.

Vivek Nanda - Postdoctoral Fellow

- PhD, Pharmacology, University of Rochester
- MS, Pharmacology, University of Rochester
- BS, Bioinformatics, Rochester Institute of Technology

Vivek is a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in Vascular Surgery at Stanford University in the Leeper Lab. He completed his undergraduate studies in Bioinformatics from the Rochester Institute of Technology, Rochester, New York, following which he joined the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston as a research technician. After gaining a couple years of experience he moved back to wintery Rochester to pursue his PhD in Pharmacology from the University of Rochester, New York. As a predoctoral candidate he defined the expression and transcriptional regulation of a rather understudied gene called Leiomodin1 and thereafter began investigating its function in cultured smooth muscle cells. He also simultaneously designed a targeting vector to inactivate the Leiomodin1 locus in mice. Upon joining Stanford, he has been actively working on investigating the function of genes located on the 9p21 locus, which are now known to be involved in coronary heart diseases. When away from lab, he plays racquetball and enjoys swimming.
