<p style="margin-left: 80px">Clint started his lab at the University of Virginia after serving on the faculty and completing his postdoctoral training in human genetics at Stanford University in the laboratory of Tom Quertermous. There he investigated the causal genetic mechanisms of coronary artery disease loci identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies in human populations. He identified the causal mechanisms for multiple genes mediating vessel wall injury responses in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells and mouse models. He is currently an Assistant Professor of Public Health Sciences and is a resident member of the Centeer for Public Health Genomics. He is also a member of the Data Science Institute and the Berne Cardiovascular Research Center and has secondary faculty appointments in the Departments of Biomedical Engineering and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics.</p>
